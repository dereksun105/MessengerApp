A messenger app

CORE
The application must support simultaneous use by multiple users over a network. New messages and conversations should appear in real-time as users add them. 
All user interactions must be GUI based. 
Data must persist regardless of whether or not a user is connected. If a user disconnects and reconnects, their data should still be present. 
Descriptive errors should appear as appropriate. The application should not crash under any circumstances. 
Users can create, edit, and delete accounts for themselves.
The attributes you collect as part of account creation are up to you. 
Users should be required to either create an account or sign in before gaining access to the application. 
Whichever identifier you maintain for the user must be unique. 
Users can create, edit, and delete messages sent to both individuals and groups.
Remember to restrict edit and delete access to the user who created the messages .
SELECTIONS
Users can create individual messaging conversations and group messaging conversations with the users of their choice.
Remember that all users must have accounts.  
Remember to restrict access to those conversations to the message participants. 
Users can see a list of all their conversations in one place. They can select a particular conversation to enter it and return to the list once they are finished. 
Users can delete a conversation from their list. 
This should not delete the conversation from the other participant's lists. 
Optional Features:
